# Better Player (Fixed Version)

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/better_player_fixed.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/better_player_fixed)
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jhomlala/betterplayer.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/jhomlala/betterplayer)
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-flutter-blue.svg)](https://github.com/jhomlala/betterplayer)

This is a **fixed version** of the original [Better Player](https://pub.dev/packages/better_player) package, created because the original developer is currently inactive. The package addresses issues such as deprecated Flutter functions and other maintenance updates.

## Original Author:

- [jhomlala](https://github.com/jhomlala)

## Changes:

- Replaced deprecated `hashValues` with `Object.hash` (Flutter 3.27.0).
- Maintained all original functionality.

This package is an enhancement of the original Better Player package, but all credits go to the original author for creating the base package.

Feel free to contribute if the original package becomes active again!
